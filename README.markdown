# Wikimedia Data and Developer Hub

## Contributing

You need Ruby, preferably with [RVM](http://rvm.io/). After cloning the
repository, when you enter the directory RVM should activate the proper
version of Ruby and create an empty gemset.

To install dependencies run:

    bundle install

To start local development server run:

    middleman server

To publish an updated version to GitHub pages run:

    rake publish

(you'll need access to the repository).
